        <h1 style="font-family:;">Who Dares Enter My Lair!</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">Hey! This is Gustavo and I am going to say a bit about myself since it is only fitting for the about me page. I am 17 years old and I enjoy playing video games, reading, hiking, photography, running, and watching Youtube. I do many extracurricular activities outside of academics such as: Book club, Hiking club, Math club, Track and Cross Country. My most favorite thing in the world is my doggo Daisy who is a beagle/labrador mix... and icecream... can't forget icecream. I don't want to make this too long and to be honest I am quite lazy so... yeah... that's all folks.</p>
